# Objectives
- [ ] Create a valid HTML document with proper syntax. Only one body, one head, etc.
- [ ] Correctly use HTML elements: h1-h6, button, a, nav, ul, li. Make good use of semantic HTML.
- [ ] The syntax can be validated with an HTML validator.
- [ ] Replicate the design as closely as possible in its "desktop" size. Make proper use of Tailwind colors and extract component classes using @apply (if needed).
- [ ] Correct use of CSS grid and Flexbox when necessary (Flexbox for components, grid for layout in general).

## Setup

In your terminal:

1. Run `npm install` to install the packages.
2. Run `npm start` to initialize Tailwind and automatically compile its classes.

**IMPORTANT!** From this point on, the terminal will be "locked," as a program will be running. This means you won’t be able to use this terminal window for tasks like `git commit`. You’ll need to open another terminal window to do that!
